### Prompting Strategy Breakdown

```python
prompt = """Provide a comprehensive, detailed guide for testing each functionality based on the provided screenshots. Each test case should include the following elements:

- Description: A clear and concise explanation of the purpose of the test.
- Pre-conditions: Outline the necessary setup or prerequisites required before conducting the test (2-4 lines that clearly explain the environment, configurations, or data that need to be in place).
- Testing Steps: Step-by-step instructions detailing how to execute the test. Ensure that the instructions are exhaustive, covering all possible conditions as would be expected in a real production environment.
- Expected Result: Describe the expected outcome if the functionality operates as intended, highlighting the criteria for success.

For multiple functionalities, break them down into individual sections, with each functionality clearly defined and the associated test cases outlined using the format above.
"""

if context:
    prompt += f"\n\nAdditional context: {context}"
```

### Components Explained

1. **Description:**
   - **Purpose:** This section provides a high-level overview of what the test case is designed to verify. It should be concise but informative enough to understand the goal of the test.
   - **Example:** "Verify that the search functionality returns relevant results when a user enters a query into the search bar."

2. **Pre-conditions:**
   - **Purpose:** These are the setup steps or conditions that must be met before executing the test. This might include configuring the environment, ensuring certain data is present, or specific settings that need to be applied.
   - **Example:** "The application must be running in a test environment with sample data preloaded. The user should be logged in with admin privileges."

3. **Testing Steps:**
   - **Purpose:** This is a detailed, step-by-step guide on how to perform the test. It should be thorough and cover all necessary actions to ensure the test is executed properly.
   - **Example:** 
     1. Open the application and navigate to the search page.
     2. Enter 'test query' into the search bar and click the search button.
     3. Observe the results displayed on the page.

4. **Expected Result:**
   - **Purpose:** This describes what should happen if the feature is working correctly. It sets the criteria for success and helps in determining whether the test passes or fails.
   - **Example:** "The search results should display relevant items related to 'test query,' with no errors or empty results."

### Adding Optional Context

- **Purpose:** The additional context provides extra information that might help in better understanding the test or in tailoring the test cases more closely to the userâ€™s requirements.
- **Example:** "The screenshots include different stages of the user registration process. Ensure that each stage is tested for both successful and unsuccessful registrations."

### Application of the Prompt

When used with your generative AI model, this prompt structure ensures that each test case is detailed and well-organized, making it easier to create comprehensive test plans from visual data. The optional context adds flexibility, allowing users to provide additional information that could refine the test cases further.
